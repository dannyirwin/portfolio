# Hello!

My name is Danny Irwin and this is my personal portfolio page! You can view it
and get in touch with me (here)[www.dannyirwin.com] It is build on react with
typescript.

The dynamic background built using p5.js. It is a play on a very simle Truchet
Tile pattern using diagonal walls to build the maze. The dots then randomly
spawn and work their way through the maze until they leave the view area or die
of "old age."
