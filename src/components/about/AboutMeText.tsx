      <p>
        I'm a Web Developer with a background in professional acting and
        customer service. I am a recent graduate of the Flatiron School software
        developer intensive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before transitioning into tech, I worked primarily as a professional
        actor. I graduated from Emerson College and worked in theatres all over
        the country for 6 years, mostly living in Philadelphia. I've also dipped
        my feet into the food and customer service industries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Off the clock I'm usually trying to learn some new hobby: recently
        woodworking. Always down for some D&D, video games, rock climbing, or to
        gush about outer space.
